    <p>my aunt lived in my house, taking care of me and my siblings, up until I was around 12 years old. her husband and her children (technically my uncle and cousins, but i've never spoken to them) lived in the Philippines, and at that point, she hadn't seen them in person for over 12 years. so when she moved back to the Philippines, it didn't come as a surprise, and i wasn't about to have a world-ending breakdown over it. that doesn't mean i didn't miss her - i missed her a lot - but i still had a part of her: her tofu recipe. she had the best tofu recipe in the world. so, after she left, i asked her for her tofu recipe, and i've been making it nonstop.</p>

<p>the point of this story is to tell you that cooking is <em>very</em>em> important in my family. that's something you give to us after you leave.</p>
