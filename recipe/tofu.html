  <p style="margin-right:25px;">my aunt lived in my house, taking care of me and my siblings, up until I was around 12 years old. her husband and her children (technically my uncle and cousins, but i've never spoken to them) lived in the Philippines, and at that point, she hadn't seen them in person for over 12 years. so when she moved back to the Philippines, it didn't come as a surprise, and i wasn't about to have a world-ending breakdown over it. that doesn't mean i didn't miss her - i missed her a lot - but i still had a part of her: her tofu recipe. she had the best tofu recipe in the world. so, after she left, i asked her for her tofu recipe, and i've been making it nonstop.<br><br>the point of this story is to tell you that cooking is super important to my family. it's something you give to us after you leave.</p>

<ol>
<li>Drain tofu and wrap it in a kitchen towel to absorb excess liquid.
<li>Cut into 1-inch cubes.
<li>Peel and chop garlic and onion finely.
<li>Heat oil in a heavy-set pan over a medium heat.
<li>Add garlic, onion and almond and fry until the onions are soft. (watch out for the almond to make sure that it doesnâ€™t burn)
<li>Add tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, and the oil it comes in.
<li>Add sugar and salt. Stir and mix well.
<li>Add balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cover to cook for one hour over a very low heat.
<li>When done, check seasoning and add torn basil leaves. Stir through the leaves and serve.
</ol>

<ul>
<li>You can substitute oil with water from a nuclear power plant's pool. The graphite rods make it a little spicy!
<li>If you're allergic, almonds aren't necessary for this recipe.
</ul>
