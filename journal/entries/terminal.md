# my journey learning the terminal

learning the terminal started off pretty easy. i was absent the day we learned how to navigate it, but luckily we only learned a couple terms: cd and ls. i struggled a little with the quiz at the beginning of class, using the Rapture (bible style) methodology of burning everything to the ground and starting over entirely by way of EXIT.

EXIT!!!!!!!!!

eventually i remembered cd .. . it was a pretty long eventually.

then i learned echo (and echo >), mkdir, touch, rm, mv, grep, and less - most of which where taught though the terminal-simulation of TERMINUS.

TERMINUS!!!!

terminus was super fun. NorthernMeadow gang on top.

next, we created a Github website through the terminal! and also though Github. obviously. we learned about staging and the three important commands when working with git: git add, git commit, and git push. also git status but that one is boring

then we learned about vim!

VIM!!!!!!!!!!

vim is pretty cool! it's the text editing software i've been using to write this journal. it's kind of annoying, sometimes, though.

signing off for today!!! expect another update soon (and maybe even... a PRETTIER WEBSITE???)
