hello :)
this is tomio. my final project was a theoretical ARLINGTON TECH CONFESSIONS website. there are these sorts of instagram accounts for other high schools in the area, but a lot of people in our grade don't use instagram (at least, my friends don't) so i wanted to use my skills to make a website! i used my friend's github account because i didn't want it connected to my repo... for whatever reason i don't know. i was inspired by old CRT tvs, which is why i have the ascii text at the top of the screen.

um. it doesn't work right now. i don't exactly know how to implement these things. but it was fun to do!!!

a link will be added when... uh... i get on my friend's computer and publish it.
