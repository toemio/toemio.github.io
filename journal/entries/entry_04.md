I studied three websites to make my website. Initially, I looked at resturants, but I found that God, I Love Soup operates more like a bookstore, but instead of books, it's soup. Bookstores often have events centered around books, like weekly book clubs, and they have seating so people can hang out and read books in the store. I added that to God, I Love Soup by creating events for the store, in which people can appreciate soup.

Finding the right theme with Wordpress was a little difficult, but I found one that was customizable enough to my liking. I could change the font and font size, which I'm pretty sure some of my classmates had trouble with. Even then, I wished I could have customized the website some more. Still, Wordpress seems like a great platform for people just starting out making their own business. It's pretty simple, except for the fact I had some trouble navigating their site. That could have just been a skill issue, though.
