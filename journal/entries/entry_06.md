a FIXED SHOOTER game, like galaga! this will mostly be based on galaga.

the objects are to get through 3 rounds of aliens trying to shoot you. you have 3 lives, and if an alien shoots you, then you lose one of those lives. you win if you get through the 3 rounds of aliens, and you lose if you are shot and you die!

How will the player interact with the game?
galaga is a Fixed shooter game, meaning you can't move forward and backward, only left and right. the player will also be able to shoot the aliens to kill them.
